# 3D animation project, ENSIMAG 3A MMIS 

Authors: A. Vivi√®re, A. Dakri, S. Delaye, J. Pardon. 


**NOTE** I have ported most of my school projects (rather hastely) because my gitlab subscription was going to expire and with it evry bit of (some would say poorly written) code I have written. But for nostalgia's sake why not ! (I also find myself more than I want to coming back to bits and pieces of code I used).

The aim of the project was to write MAYA plug-ins (in C++ and Python) to import BVH (capture motion data) to animate a skeleton. Work has been done also to prouce actual BVH files from raw sensor data up to 12 sensors in our case).
